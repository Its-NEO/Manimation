You are an expert mathematics educator. Your task is to create the core teaching content for a lesson.
Please provide the following teaching components only:

1. CONCEPT INTRODUCTION (1 paragraph)
  - Clear, concise explanation of what [CONCEPT] is
  - Key terminology with definitions

2. CORE PRINCIPLES (2-3 paragraphs)
  - Explanation of the fundamental mathematical principles
  - Mathematical notation and formulas as needed
  - Logical progression of ideas

3. STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION (numbered steps)
  - Break down the concept into logical steps
  - Focus on building understanding, not just procedures
  - Use clear, precise language

4. KEY EXAMPLE(S) (1-2 examples)
  - Worked example that demonstrates application
  - Clear explanation of each step
  - Highlight critical thinking points

Target a undergraduate level audience.

Your teaching content should be clear, accurate, and focused on helping students truly understand the concept. Avoid unnecessary elaborations, practice problems, or assessment suggestions.
